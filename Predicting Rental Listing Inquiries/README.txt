Abstract

Two Sigma and RentHop held a Kaggle competition, in which competitors were asked to predict how popular an apartment rental listing is based on the listing content, such as text description, photos, price, etc. In this project, with Python, ensemble learning was applied via Random Forrest, KNN, Logistic Regression, Neural Network and XGBoost, and tuned the parameter via cross validation.
